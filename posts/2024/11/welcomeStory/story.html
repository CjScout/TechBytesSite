  <p>This is a little intro I wrote for promoting my podcast, I think it sums up the project well.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>In the past few years, I've enjoyed building my skills with technology in so many ways. I could credit many people for helping me get where I am today, starting with my CIS teacher in High School, who has pushed me as Lead Student Administrator in ways I never thought possible. I also need to credit everyone at UNH InterOperability Lab as I built my first production web application and the mentors I've had at Best Buy as I've built my customer service skills.
    <br><br>
    Throughout these last few years, I've seen technology advance exponentially. I started following technology when the NVIDIA RTX 20 series was brand new, and PCIe Gen 4 devices such as NVMe SSDs were just rolling out. We're on the brink of NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, and PCIe Gen 6 has been released too. On top of all that, we've got AI and machine learning appearing everywhere you look. While my technical friends understand these advances, what I have not seen advance is consumers understanding of these technologies. If I asked my aunt or cousin what the difference was between an LLM and machine learning, they wouldn't have a clue. Even at my high school, I see misconceptions and confusion all over the place.
    <br><br>
    These knowledge gaps cause many, many unhappy consumers. Many people have come through Best Buy with no idea what they're looking for, or have some inexplicable computer problem. Fortunately for them, the team at my store is on their game, and our Sales Advisors and Geek Squad Agents usually catch and help these people.
    <br><br>
    The non-technical people in my life also have me as a resource, and I often find myself on a call with my grandfather or aunt helping them. However, not everyone buys at Best Buy or has someone they can go to for help.
    <br><br>
    To that end, I'd like to introduce my Senior Capstone Project. Tech Bytes is a podcast-style series created by me, where I attempt to bridge this knowledge gap. Every 2 weeks, I plan to release an episode that dives into 3-4 major technological developments in ways that regulate consumers can easily understand. An educated consumer is a happy one! Available on basically any podcast platform, I hope you try it. A show trailer and the first episode are available now! Oh, and if anyone in your life would benefit from it, please consider sharing! Thanks for reading!</p>
